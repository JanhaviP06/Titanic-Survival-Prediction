# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-System

This project aims to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing a dataset of passenger information, including attributes such as age, gender, class, and fare, the system can provide insights and predictions on passenger survival.The system is made using streamlit.

**Usage**
* Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook
* Open the Titanic Survival Prediction.ipynb notebook.
* Follow the instructions and execute the code cells to preprocess the data, build the predictive model, and make predictions on new passenger data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project, train.csv, contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including the following attributes:

* Survival: Whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Sex: Passenger gender (male or female)
* Age: Passenger age in years
* SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
* Fare: Passenger fare
* Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

**Model Evaluation**

The model's performance is evaluated using relevant evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The notebook also includes visualizations to help understand the data and the model's performance.
